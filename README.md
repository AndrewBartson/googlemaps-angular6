# Super Trucker - Angular 6 + Google Maps

## Open the Project

In your terminal, enter `ng serve` to start up a dev server. Then view the site in your browser: `http://localhost:4200/` However the "Create Route" button won't work because the backend API is not deployed. The backend code is not open source.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Run tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
